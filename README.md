# Name of Practicals Included in Repo:

1. Binary Search using Divide and Conquer - 
Using divide and conquer method write a program for Binary Search.

2. Merge Sort using Divide and Conquer -
Using divide and conquer method and recursive approach write a program to sort the list using top 
down Merge Sort.

3. Quick Sort using Divide and Conquer - 
Sort a given set of n integer elements using Quick Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run 
the program for varied values of n and record the time taken to sort. Demonstrate how the divide and 
conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case.

4. Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication using Divide and Conquer -
Write a program to implement Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication

5. Fractional Knapsack Problem Using Greedy Method -
Using greedy method write a program to implement Fractional Knapsack problem.

6. Single Source Shortest Path Problem for non negative weights -
From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph with non negative weights, write a program to find 
the shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstra’s algorithm. 

7. Single Source Shortest Path Problem with negative weights -
Write a program to implement Bellman Ford algorithm for solving single source shortest path problem 
considering negative weights for graph.

8. All Pair Shortest Path Algorithm -
Write a program to implement Floyd-Warshall algorithm for solving all pairs shortest path problem.

9. Breadth First Search -
Write a program to create a graph and traverse using Breadth First Search.

10. Depth First Search -
Write a program to create a graph and traverse using Depth First Search.

11. Minimum Spanning Tree -
Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected undirected graph using Prim’s 
algorithm.
